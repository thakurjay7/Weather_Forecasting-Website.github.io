It's a responsive weather forecasting website that provides current weather information for various locations. Users can easily access the weather data by simply entering the postal or zip code along with the country code. If you're unsure about these codes, there's also an intuitive icon on the website that, when clicked, redirects you to a website with information about these codes.
